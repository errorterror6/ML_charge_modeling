# training trce latent ode

    constrain training dataset to ~0-1, positive time (log10) 0-2.5

    z x16 capable of fit


        optimise beta and train regime, still room to reduce loss after 1000 iterations


    anneal beta from .001 up order magnitude each 100 epochs, keep learn rate 1e-3

    at beta = 1., run 1000 epochs


    # latent state analysis


        z0 shows strong delay time dependence - initial charge desnity?

            shape shows total charge density


        z1 closely matches dependence (vlt, del) of z0

            shape indicates space charge limited extraction? trapped charge density

                mobile free carriers (recombination)?


        z7 shows strong voltage dependence, no delay dependence - bias extraction kinetics

            shape shows rate of extraction

            stronger bias depedence at long delay, extraction of relaxed/trapped charge


        z2 shows highly linear voltage dependence - no delay dependence

            shape exhibits rc decay time


        z4 increase at long delay time, drop at high intensity/bias

            shape early transient magnitude shift, no time shift

            average recombination lifetime? fraction recombination loss

            increase to saturate with applied bias, reduced at long delay time

                spatial separation of carriers under bias, reduced recombination


        z5 dependence on intensity, not voltage or delay

            rate of extraction for (z5) early ~100-500ns extraction

            space charge limited extraction (slow RC competitive charge extraction ~100ns)

            slower at increased initial excitation density, only significant at lowest intensity

                non-uniform photogeneration, early spatial redistribution


        z6 dependence on voltage, delay

            slight deviation at limits of low charge desnity (int, del)

            rate of extraction for ~1 us time periods

            decrease at high bias, low intensity, long delay

                internal mobile charge reserviour extraction

            increase from no bias to slight bias (otherwise recombine)

                higher bias reduce (carriers pulled to contacts, spatial separation)


        z3 almost no impact, blend between z5 and z6 (separation of carrier populations)

            slight separate of early (100ns) vs mid (500ns) vs late (1us) extraction periods

            very slight delay time dep, minimal vlt/int dep

            (low vlt long del ie low internal field) separation of mobile and trapped carriers

                relaxation of carriers into traps, separation of mobile and free carriers


# summary latent state dynamics

    z0 - initial (photogenerated less delay time recombination) charge density

    z1 - space charge limited extraction (delay in extraction at high charge density)

    z2 - bias dependent rc decay

    z3 - carrier relaxation, separation of mobile and trapped carriers

    z4 - spatial separation of carriers under bias, reduced recombination

    z5 - non-uniform spatial distribution of initial photogenerated carriers

    z6 - internal mobile charge reserviour extraction, spatial separation to contacts

    z7 - applied bias influence on extraction rate, trap extraction
