    trce transient, extraction effectively complete within 1e-5 s (start 1e-7)

    pvd transient, tracks trce behaviour after 1e-5, interesting behaviour prior



        scale part 2 pvd by final value part 1 (align transients) before join

            join: interpolate + concat


        sample 21, pvd time axis offset +130ns

            subtract 1.3e-7 for comparison to sample set


- objectives - study of:

    n-dependent carrier mobilities

    recombination lifetimes

    density of states distribution
